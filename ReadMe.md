Here is a general outline of the steps involved in multi-model deployment:

Model Development:

Build and train multiple machine learning models.
Evaluate the performance of each model to ensure they meet the desired performance criteria.
Model Versioning:

Use version control for your models to keep track of different versions.
Tools like MLflow, DVC, or Git can be used for model versioning.
Containerization:

Containerize your models using Docker or a similar technology.
This ensures that the models can be deployed consistently across different environments.
Model Serving:

Use a model serving platform like TensorFlow Serving, TorchServe, or KFServing.
These platforms allow you to serve multiple models simultaneously.
API Gateway:

Set up an API gateway to route requests to the appropriate model.
This can be done using tools like NGINX, AWS API Gateway, or Azure API Management.
Monitoring and Logging:

Implement monitoring and logging to track the performance and usage of each model.
Tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK stack can be used for this purpose.
Scaling:

Use orchestration tools like Kubernetes to manage the scaling of your model deployments.
Ensure that your infrastructure can scale up or down based on the load.
Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):

Set up CI/CD pipelines to automate the deployment of new models or updates to existing models.
Tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI/CD can be used for this purpose.This repo demonstrates sample code for multi model deploy on different cloud platforms.
